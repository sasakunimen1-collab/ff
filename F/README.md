| The Gusher is a hazardous creature, he likes to wander <br> around and rest in sneaky places.<br>He is completely blind.. <br> But a good listener in compensation. <br> Very sensitive personality however.| Very much like the Gusher. <br> However, the Roaster likes to keep the conversations short. <br> He's the upgrade. <br> Not common in earlier levels. <br> Probably a good thing...|

| The Droid                                      | The Destroyer                                   |

| This poor droid was left to fend on his own. <br> We are not sure what he's up to now but.. <br> I am sure he'll be pleased to see some fellow droids. | His look matches his behaviour. <br> Do not try to interact with this creature. <br> Avoid.|

| The Soldier                                 | The Voodoo                                  |

| Heard his brother was a hunter. <br> However, this one might not be as real as he looks. <br> Listen for his crazy mumbling. <br> He was first spotted in this place called Redfield Bunker...| We're not sure what this thing truly is. <br>But we recommend you stay away, do not let it touch you.<br>We have not yet found a way to kill it.<br> But there must be a way.<br>Stay. Away.|
